# Project Abandoned

**Date:** February 8, 2026

This project was abandoned in favor of [Makerkit](https://makerkit.dev/) ($299,
lifetime license), a commercially maintained Next.js + Supabase SaaS boilerplate
that already ships everything this project planned to build — and more.

**Why:** The entire feature set (auth, RBAC, admin dashboard, audit logging) is a
subset of what Makerkit provides out of the box, with daily maintenance and
updates handled by someone else. Building and maintaining a custom template was
not worth the effort.

**See:** `docs/RECOMMENDATION-starter-kit-evaluation.md` for the full analysis,
and `docs/CHECKLIST-makerkit-setup.md` for the replacement setup guide.
