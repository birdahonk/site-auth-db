# Session Log: 20260208_202013

**Date:** February 8, 2026 20:20 PST (February 9, 2026 04:20 UTC)
**Branch:** master
**Latest Commit:** 93ebd4e "docs: add starter kit evaluation and Makerkit setup checklist"

---

## Overview

This session marks the **end of the site-auth-db project**. After restoring context from the previous session, the conversation shifted to evaluating reusability strategy and the broader SaaS boilerplate landscape. Extensive research into commercial starter kits (Makerkit, Nextbase, ShipFast, Supastarter, Open SaaS, create-t3-app, Clerk starters, Better Auth templates) led to the conclusion that Makerkit already ships everything this project planned to build -- and more -- at a one-time cost of $299 with lifetime updates.

All 10 TaskMaster tasks have been **cancelled**. The project is effectively archived. Two reference documents were created to preserve the analysis and provide a clear migration path to Makerkit.

**Project Status: ABANDONED / ARCHIVED in favor of Makerkit (makerkit.dev)**

## Completed Work

### 1. Session Context Restoration
Clocked in and restored context from previous session (20260208_180252), which had completed tech stack hardening (Next.js 14 to 16, Tailwind v3 to v4, @supabase/ssr).

### 2. Reusability Strategy Discussion
Identified gaps in the template clone workflow and questioned whether building from scratch was the right approach given the maturity of the SaaS boilerplate ecosystem.

### 3. SaaS Boilerplate Landscape Research
Researched and compared multiple starter kit options:

| Kit | Stack Match | Price | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Makerkit** | Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind v4, @supabase/ssr, shadcn/ui | $299 lifetime | **Selected** |
| Nextbase | Next.js, Supabase | $249-$399 | Good but less active |
| ShipFast | Next.js, various DBs | $199 one-time | Different DB focus |
| Supastarter | Next.js, Supabase | $299-$599 | Comparable but pricier |
| Open SaaS (Wasp) | React, Prisma | Free (OSS) | Different framework |
| create-t3-app | Next.js, tRPC, Prisma | Free (OSS) | No auth/admin built-in |
| Clerk starters | Various | Free + Clerk pricing | Vendor lock-in |
| Better Auth templates | Various | Free (OSS) | Minimal scaffolding |

### 4. Deep-Dive: Makerkit vs This Project
Detailed comparison of Makerkit Pro features against our planned implementation:

| Feature | site-auth-db (Planned) | Makerkit (Ships Today) |
|---|---|---|
| Auth (email, OAuth, MFA) | Task 3 (not started) | Included |
| RBAC / Tier system | Task 4 (not started) | Included (roles + permissions) |
| Admin dashboard | Task 6 (not started) | Included |
| Audit logging | Task 8 (not started) | Included |
| API layer | Task 9 (not started) | Included |
| Payments (Stripe/Lemon Squeezy) | Not planned | Included |
| Email (Resend/Postmark) | Not planned | Included |
| Blog / CMS | Not planned | Included |
| Multi-tenancy / Organizations | Not planned | Included |
| i18n | Not planned | Included |

### 5. Created Build-vs-Buy Analysis Document
Created `docs/RECOMMENDATION-starter-kit-evaluation.md` with:
- Comprehensive comparison of all evaluated kits
- Feature matrix (site-auth-db vs Makerkit)
- Cost analysis: $299 one-time vs 2-4 weeks development + ongoing maintenance
- Risk assessment for both approaches
- Clear recommendation to use Makerkit

### 6. Created Makerkit Setup Checklist
Created `docs/CHECKLIST-makerkit-setup.md` with:
- CLI-first setup instructions for Makerkit
- Supabase project configuration steps
- Vercel deployment guide
- Custom domain + Pair Networks DNS setup
- Post-deployment verification checklist

### 7. Committed Documentation
All new documents committed as 93ebd4e.

### 8. Cancelled All TaskMaster Tasks
Marked all 10 tasks as "cancelled" in `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json`:
1. Initialize Next.js 16 Project
2. Configure Supabase Integration
3. Implement Authentication System
4. Create Tier-Based Access Control
5. Build Protected Dashboard/Profile
6. Develop Admin Dashboard
7. Implement Admin User Management
8. Create Audit Logging
9. Implement API Layer
10. Setup Production Deployment

## Current Status

### Active Task
None -- project is closed.

### Work in Progress
None.

### TaskMaster Task Status
All 10 tasks are **cancelled**. No implementation work was ever started on any task.

---

## Pending Items

### TODOs
No Claude Code todos were created this session (work tracked via TaskMaster tasks, all now cancelled).

### Blockers
None -- project is closed.

---

## Technical Context

### Code Changes
No source code was written. This project never progressed past the planning and documentation phase. The `web/` directory contains only `.gitkeep` placeholder files.

### Configuration Updates
No configuration files were modified.

### Files Changed This Session
| File | Action | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/RECOMMENDATION-starter-kit-evaluation.md` | CREATED | Comprehensive build-vs-buy analysis recommending Makerkit |
| `docs/CHECKLIST-makerkit-setup.md` | CREATED | CLI-first setup checklist for Makerkit + Supabase + Vercel + custom domain |
| `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` | MODIFIED | All 10 tasks set to "cancelled" |

## Conversation Highlights

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Project abandoned in favor of Makerkit**: The commercial boilerplate ships everything planned and more, at $299 one-time with lifetime updates. Building from scratch would take 2-4 weeks and require ongoing maintenance.

2. **Deployment target changed from VPS to Vercel**: The original project included nginx + PM2 configs for self-hosted VPS deployment. This unique aspect was eliminated when the deployment target shifted to Vercel, removing the last differentiator from commercial kits.

3. **Repo to be archived as reference material**: The PRD, tier system design, RLS policy planning, and tech stack research remain valuable as reference documentation for future projects, even though no code was implemented.

4. **Makerkit Pro tier selected ($299)**: The Pro tier provides unlimited projects, lifetime updates, and the full feature set needed. The Lite (free) tier can be evaluated first before purchasing.

### Important Discussions

- **Tech stack drift risk**: The project was planned in December 2025 with Next.js 14 / Tailwind v3 but required hardening to Next.js 16 / Tailwind v4 in February 2026 before any code was written. This drift would continue with a custom-maintained project.

- **Buy vs build economics**: For a solo developer, $299 for a professionally maintained boilerplate with daily updates is dramatically more efficient than 2-4 weeks of development plus ongoing maintenance burden.

- **Makerkit stack alignment**: Makerkit uses the exact same technology stack this project targeted: Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind v4, @supabase/ssr, shadcn/ui. This means the research and planning done for site-auth-db directly applies to customizing Makerkit.

## Next Actions

These actions are for **future reference** -- they relate to the Makerkit migration, not to this project:

1. **Evaluate Makerkit Lite (free)**: Clone and explore the architecture
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/makerkit/nextjs-saas-starter-kit-lite.git
   ```
2. **Purchase Makerkit Pro ($299)** at makerkit.dev if the Lite evaluation is satisfactory
3. **Follow setup checklist**: Use `docs/CHECKLIST-makerkit-setup.md` for full Makerkit + Supabase + Vercel + custom domain setup
4. **Archive this repository**: Mark as archived on GitHub to preserve reference material

## Project Retrospective

This project served as a valuable learning exercise despite never producing application code:

1. **Architecture design**: The tier system (0-3), RLS policy patterns, and four-client Supabase setup are reusable patterns documented in the PRD and CLAUDE.md.
2. **Tech stack research**: The February 2026 hardening session produced a thorough TECH_STACK.md that documents Next.js 16 / Tailwind v4 / @supabase/ssr patterns.
3. **Build-vs-buy analysis**: The starter kit evaluation is a reusable framework for future technology decisions.
4. **Session management**: The clock-in/clock-out workflow and session log system proved effective for maintaining context across sessions.

**Total sessions:** 3 (Dec 16, 2025; Feb 8, 2026 x2)
**Total implementation code written:** 0 lines
**Outcome:** Replaced by Makerkit ($299) -- a well-maintained commercial solution shipping the same stack and features.
